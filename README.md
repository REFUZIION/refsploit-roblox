# REFSPLOiT - ROBLOX SCRIPT EXECUTOR (WRD)

REFSPLOiT v1.0 is a outdated ROBLOX script executor written in C#. With support from the WeAreDevsAPI.

NOTE: The WRD API does reading and writing on administrator level so it gives a false positive. If your anti-virus flags or deletes the file you can redownload it from their website.
